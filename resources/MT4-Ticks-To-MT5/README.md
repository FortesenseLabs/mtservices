# MT4-Ticks-To-MT5
Thank you @fxsaber for the Symbol library.

# Lets take a look at the instruction for deployment.

#### In MT5:

	1) Copy the complete project in the Experts directory  of the MQL5 as it is.
	2) Compile MT5.mq5 once to make sure it is working.
#### In MT4:

	1) Copy the complete project in the Experts Directory of the MQL4 as it is.
	2) Copy the sym_port.txt in the MQL4 ---> Files Directory. (I could not load the file from the same folder. So I have to move it to teh files folder. I was not able to find a method for its inclusion, if someone has idea please share so I can neglect this step.)
	3) Compile the MT4.mq4 file once to make sure it is working.
### Note:

##### First apply the MT4.mq4 on the chart.

##### Then apply the MT5 on the chart of the same symbol. Otherwise it will not work.

Have a look at the image:
